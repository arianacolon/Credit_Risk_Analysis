# Credit Card Risk Analysis with Supervised Machine Learning
##Overview
Machine learning models are able to process large amounts of data to arrive at a single decision. These models can specifically be applied to banks and financial institutions to help them monitor porfolios, predict credit risk, and lead to a more accurate identification of good candidates for loans, resulting in lower default rates. Jill, the lead data scientist at LendingClub, has asked me to analyze the credit card credit dataset from the LendingClub to predict credit risk. I will use six different machine learning models to predict the credit risk. The first two, RandomOverSampler and SMOTE, are algorithms used to oversample the data. The third algorithm, ClusterCentroids, is used to undersample the data. SMOTEENN is the fourth algorithm, which uses a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling the data. The last two machine learning models, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, will predict credit risk by reducing bias. 
###Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to predict credit card risk with the six machine learning models. After calculating the models' balanced accuracy score and their precision and recall scores, I will recommend to Jill which model to use.
